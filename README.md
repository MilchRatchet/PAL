# PAL

`PAL` (Polytime Algorithm Libraries) is a `C/C++` library collection containing a multitude of algorithms with polynomial time complexity. Currently `PAL` consists of the following libraries:

- `AAL` (Approximation Algorithm Library)
- `CGL` (Computational Geometry Library)
- `VLL` (Visualization Layer Library)
