# PAL

`PAL` (Polytime Algorithm Libraries) is a `C/C++` library collection containing a multitude of algorithms with polynomial time complexity. Currently `PAL` consists of the following libraries:

- `AAL` (Approximation Algorithm Library)
- `CGL` (Computational Geometry Library)
- `VLL` (Visualization Layer Library)

# Requirements

## Linux (Debian-based)

For `VLL` you need to install `SDL2`. For development use
```
apt-get install libsdl2-dev
```
